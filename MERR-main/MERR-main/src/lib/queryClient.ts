/**
 * queryClient.ts — React Query configuration
 * 
 * Central QueryClient with defaults tuned for a field-worker PWA:
 * - 5 min staleTime (field data doesn't change every second)
 * - 30 min gcTime (keep cache warm for offline-first)
 * - 2 retries with exponential backoff
 * - No refetch on window focus (workers switch apps a lot)
